That wasn't clear to me when I answered the question.    IN that case, I think it's important to first diagnose what caused the drop in Marketplace messages before jumping into the trade off.  If after, all the possible root causes eliminated and you are convinced that it is in fact caused by a new feature in Shops, then I would want to understand if the drop in messages is impacting the success of Marketplace, (again, for marketplace, your success metric is # of items sold).  If the drop in messages is correlated with drop in # of items sold in Marketplace,  then you are trading off items being sold in Marketplace with items being sold in Shops. With the introduction of Shops feature,  it's reasonable to assume that people who used to sell in Marketplace are now opening shops in Shops.   It would then make sense to look at the total of Marketplace and Shops items sold and make sure it's growing. So rather than looking at each, you're making sure the total is growing at a healthy rate.

We recently determined that 60% of visitors across all Shopify-powered online stores view the store's return policy page. We think this is because the ease of returning an item is part of a customer’s purchasing decision (“should I buy this or not?”).

However, merchants receive no support from Shopify in providing a good returns experience for their customers other than:
providing a simple default returns policy,
supporting a returns policy page in most themes, and 
the capability for a merchant to send money back to a customer

Our hypothesis is that better support for friendly returns processes will ultimately make our merchants more successful. Assuming you have 6 months and a fully staffed team, how would you go about tackling this problem?

Scope Definition
Choice of PM: Senior PMs since they have to manage roadmap, resourcing tradeoffs & also build products & drive GTM. Largest TAM segment.
Objective: If this tool is successful, PMs should be able to a) deliver more projects on time & b) have the entire team aligned on the problem, solution & metrics which should lead to better quality products with increased productivity. 
Success Metrics & Outcomes:
Input metrics: a) reduction in PRD delays, Execution delays, GTM delays b) reduced escalations on alignment misses leading leading to 
Output metrics: improved biz outcomes and more products launched successfully/quarter


User Journey, Existing Solutions & Unmet Needs

Creation & Closure of Action Items 

Tracking of action items is a key user requirement which is reflected in identifying priority business problems at the roadmap stage. It is also required when putting together the business problem & identifying product solves. Unmet needs are on the following lines.

Inconvenience in creating action items which are not focused on product building:
There exist tools like Asana & Trello to track action items but they are fairly inconvenient to set up. A roadmap of 7-8 projects with 8-10 action items in each would require the user to do at least 60-80 clicks on the drag & drop UI which is far more inconvenient than setting up a Google sheet. Unfortunately, none of these task management tools allow consumption from Sheets/Excel. 
Additionally, product focused roadmap & PRD action item tracking can be standardized into frameworks to create convenience for PMs to start tracking but is missing right now. Miro has taken a shot at creating product focused templates while storyboarding but no such solutions exist for action item tracking.
Reminders & Escalations  - No task management tool currently supports reminders & escalations across channels like email & slack on priority threads.

Roadmap Creation, Consumption & Tradeoffs
The list of initiatives needs to be prioritised with tradeoffs on resourcing vs impact and needs to be aligned with product & biz leadership. This also needs to be consumed by engineering.
Creating tradeoffs & options is inconvenient: While JIRA allows for creating epics & stories, it does not solve for creating a set of initiatives tagged to metrics so that the net view can be presented to leadership with multiple options/tradeoffs. Creating multiple views & tradeoffs has to be done on Google sheets.
Inconvenient to revisit during PRD stage: This is usually on some Google sheet that is rarely referenced except for execution reviews with leadership. Not having this easily accessible leads to forgotten scope, scope bloat & inability to manage feedback.
Building mental models for thinking & presentation using visual aids is well solved by Miro. Hence, it is not considered as an unmet need in the roadmap stage.

Creating Product Requirements: PMs will use JIRA only if it is mandated by engineering. PMs prefer Docs over JIRA for writing requirements. 

No single convenient tool that allows for the comfort of writing & rigour of tracking:  Google docs is far more convenient than JIRA for creating product requirements since it provides maximum convenience. On JIRA, a PM writing a PRD with 8-9 user stories will have to click on their UI at least 30 times which is a lot more hassle than just doing core writing work on Docs. However, JIRA is used by engineering for consumption of requirements and translation to JIRA from Docs will always have mistakes in copy paste or clarity gaps.

Prototyping & Metric Tracking: Both problems have solutions such as Figma or Snowflake which are heavily focused on the designer or the analyst. There does not exist a solution which enables PMs to do easy prototyping & metric tracking on the vast majority of simple requests.


Prioritising Feature Requests:
For a senior PM, the true value of the product is when the tool is able to help drive alignment on the product vision & expected product launches faster. Hence, AI-1 on action item tracking will drive our core success metrics the best. 
2 helps PMs align engg & all other stakeholders to consume the roadmap & can also be used to align upward leadership. Hence, this will also be critical to PMF.
3 is focused towards easy consumption of requirements which is a convenience feature.
Similarly for 4, PMs usually have UX & Analytics resources to help & hence can be managed. Hence, 4 is also a convenience feature with much higher effort required since it requires capability building on UX & Querying which are very different products than the rest of the above.
Hence PMF: 1 & 2. (1 & 2) > 3 > 4 in order of execution.

Solution Space: PMF Features

Convenient Creation & Tracking of AIs for Roadmap & PRD Closure: Users should be able to create action items/plan conveniently for usecases such as a) roadmap creation & b) PRD closure.  
Be capable of importing action item/execution plan from Google sheets or have a Google sheet like UX that can be converted into a task tracker with capabilities such as ETAs, owners & priorities. 
Have reminders & escalation mechanisms for high priority action items by reaching out to owners & creating threads on email & slack. Users can choose to enable reminders or have them set to default on threads & sub-threads. This can be further enhanced by integrating with the org matrix (HR tech tools) as a fast follower & escalating to owners on high priority action tasks.
Have intelligent nudging on the number of priorities (too many priorities is a bad sign). 

Convenient Consumption of Roadmap for Engg Estimation & Tradeoffs for Upward Leaders:
Convenient creation of high-level reqs: One-stop shop where PMs can write a high level initiative list with breakdown of user stories. This can either be a google sheets type editor or can import from an existing sheet. 
Automated Engg Consumption & Easy Effort Estimation: This tool should allow integration with JIRA for engineering consumption & automate creation of epics & stories. Effort estimates can be added on JIRA which can sync back to this tool. Also engineers should be able to add high-level effort estimates directly on the tool.
Easy creation of tradeoff views: PMs should also be able to create custom metrics using this tool & create a roadmap view of resourcing vs impact using the inputs mentioned.

Would end the case here in limited time while focusing on roadmap & alignment of action items. 


If we have more time, will focus on the other engagement features such as:

Convenience Features for Repeat Usage:
Convenient JIRA consumption of Requirements: This tool should also allow PMs to write requirements in a simple text editor format. The text editor can be pre-populated with a template using the high-level stories mentioned above. When users write requirements on this editor, it should automate addition of details in JIRA tickets.
Convenient Consumption of UX in PRD: No need to copy paste designs on Figma, integration with product stories that allow UX designers to create UX under user story folders & auto-populate on PRD. Prototyping on the text editor as a fast follower as a one-stop shop for engg to consume.
Quick Prototyping: Enable quick drag & drop prototyping on standard UX templates 
Quick Querying: Convenient natural language based querying of simple metrics using templates.

Hence habits need to be created at a younger age. 
Segments: young adults (18-24 yr old) x need to deepen their cooking skills and education around food
Hence my product should be:
- lasting in time
- evolve with phases of life
- not be a one-time app

Pb I chose to focus on (listed 5)
- I don't know how to cook hence going to the easiest prepped meal first
- I don't know when I need to log my food what quantities I've eaten (and weighing through scale adds incredible friction to process)

Solutions:
- Blue Apron x Instacart
Get recipes delivered to you and shopping list items already pre-selected for you in-app (through partners like Instacart or their own shopping inventory) and have that list items' nutrients logged in your app

Universal hand-measurement system

6-7%

noticed in service booking
mainly home related, personal services.

which activity are we referring to?
complete bookings.

timeframe in which it happened?
last week only its observed.

which platform?
no website, mobile app.
",Strategical Breakdown(Root Cause Analysis),Other,"Interview Framework:

Internal factors: 
start with your product

Any changes by other teams

Any changes within the company

External factors: 
Political changes, global landscape changes, competitor changes





is our data about decline accurate? any issues with tool identified?
yes
any historical patterns similar.
maybe in past, not in recent times.
question regarding users, old or new
no pattern
demographic decline?
no
any new changes released?
yes, updated, cosmetic changes(ux)
Analyze user journey in depth.
login, browse the service he's looking for, goes through prices and timeslots.
what is observed is everything on these steps remain consistent, discovery is happening properly.
detail page once selected service, any changes here?
yes, providing more details and background on service providers.
What is the additional information added apart from the basic information like price and user ratings?
Yes, review section added, also custom services that particular person would provide added(Long text answers).
Since these are most recent changes, lets focus on these, any changes in booking button position?
Yes
conclusion1: It can be one of the scenario, can we check with analytics team if scrolling down to booking button at the bottom is causing changes?




External factors check"":
Any specific changes done on checkout page?
No
Any specific competitor/stakeholders/marketing changes anything?
yes, but not in last one week.
Since, pandemic time, any effects from external sources like people's reluctance to services etc?
Not people but some societies adhered strict guidelines on outsiders entering.
conclusion2: users will look for someone local rather than outsider.
Any media narratives about such services transferring news which blew out of proportion?
No
User check: had it fallen across all services like this or limited to only our service?
Return question: how would look at play store to validate this?
Check number of installs, uninstalls and recent reviews.








Now summarize :STAR(Situation, Task, Action, Result)

Problem(Drop in DA user)
Went with a narrow down inside to outside approach.
Gone through the recent changes done in the last week in ui improvement, change in booking button.
To address this, launch it to our internal users.take feedback from them
Check if any specific issues raised on playstore reviews and our internal users
in external factors,
guidelines by societies, out of control but from our point, we can do stronger marketing that we are covid free.
